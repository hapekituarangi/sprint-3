###What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works? 

The site rescales itself and changes the styling to suit the smaller screen dimension. This works using media queries. Media queries can be used to scale your site to better fit the users screen size. Meadia quires are also a convenient way of using custom styling for different screen sizes e.g. full/100% width of elements for Mobile and Tablet devices and 85% width for desktop and laptops.
