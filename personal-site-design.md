#Personal Site Design

###What is the primary purpose of my site?

To capture and share my journey of becoming a junior Web Developer at the Enspiral Dev Academy. Eventually I’d like to see it become a portfolio that I can use to share with potential employers. 

###Who is your target audience?

I see it as a great opportunity to share my experiences and projects with work collogues, friends and family. These are the people who are already interested in my journey at EDA. Second to try design and develop it in way that will hopefully one day give potential employers a true and honest insight into who I am, my background/experiences and also my future aspirations.

###How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I hope that the site will be designed in way that encourages users/visitors to have a look around and want to find out more. I want users to feel as though they are getting an honest/authentic and real insight into my EDA journey and who I am, what I’d be like in/as a person.

###How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

By keeping the site simple and clean, with neutral colours. The focus should be kept or directed to the main content area in the middle of the site and complimented by one of my personal images used as the banner at the top of the site. Although I am not the best writer I aim to keep my blogs and other writings honest to who I am and what I believe, with the hope of giving people a real taste of me.
